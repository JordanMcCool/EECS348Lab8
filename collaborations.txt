Below is the listed explaination for the makefile from gpt

CXX = g++ → Uses g++ as the compiler.

CXXFLAGS → Includes:

-Wall -Wextra -pedantic (for better warnings),

-std=c++11 (ensures compatibility with C++11).
    // interesting

TARGET = matrix_operations → Sets the output executable name.

SRCS = matrix_operations.cpp → Lists the source files.
    // btw i already can tell this is wrong, should be base.cpp

OBJS = $(SRCS:.cpp=.o) → Converts source files into object files (.o).

all: $(TARGET) → The default action compiles the program.

$(TARGET): $(OBJS) → Links object files to create the final executable.

%.o: %.cpp → Compiles .cpp files into .o files.

clean: → Removes compiled files when you run make clean.

run: → Runs the compiled program when you type make run.

// ive decided to compile this under a different name so that i can tell if it works or not

// base.exe is created TIME STAMP 10:19
// seems to run
// NOW we get to try the makefile :L
wait how do i run the make file
i love windows
