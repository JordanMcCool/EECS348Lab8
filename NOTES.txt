I do not understand what happened, but while working on LAB09 something about lab08 stopped working (did it ever even work right?)
( i had orignally made it on a different system, do i have some version difference or something????)

Only signifcant change was line 405 std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); // fix for issue ??? 4/9/2025
which resolved the issue
i reiterate that I do not understand WHY this stopped working:
Likely options:
    1.) While testing checked only that it ran correctly without obvious errors, not that the *OUTPUTS* themeselves were what they were supposed to be
        But i dont understand why I would have done this since I made a specific test file for it to run on
            - main() i think is the issue (or atleast, changing it fixed the issue bu that doesnt necessarily mean it was the issue)
                main() was also written first
                    - hence the switch from std::cout to printf()
                    - possible that it worked fine initially but stopped after finishing the rest of the program

        honestly this is the most likely option, that I tested it but not in a way that made it apparent that it wasnt working
        that is so upsetting

    2.) Overwrote a local version at somepoint
        I tend to open all previous labs/assignments in vs code while making the project
        and would have opened this lab specifically while working on assignment 6 (the sudoku puzzle) (a)
        which used a similar structure ( 2d vector) to function
        possible that while tabbing between them, overwrote part of base.cpp
            - (b) also possible that it happen currently during lab09, because until RIGHT NOW (2-3 hours in) i had both files
                named base.cpp - multiple points where i was in the wrong one

There were a couple minor changes to formatting (just spaces on cout lines) which is actually what prompted me to double
that lab08 was reading the lines correctly.
( IF it is reason 2b, then this is why - i was specifically tabbing back and forth trying to remember how it readlines
    and was specically altering small details back and forth)
    - since this is ultimately a formatting cause ( I THINK ), then it could have been this
i didnt bother to note these lines, as the changes were extremely minor
i BEG, hands and KNEES, for mercy
